# Static Comp Challenge 1

Itâ€™s the middle of week three. This is the first project submitted since Dog Party (December 3, 2018). This week and last week the focus has been on learning to balance time between two projects: a randomly paired project as well as a solo project. This is the result of the solo project. The project was similar to Dog Party as they both involved turning a 1-page static comp into a 1-page static site. 

# Goals 

- Improving from last week
- Creating well structured, semantic HTML
- Creating clean, precise, and D.R.Y. ("Don't Repeat Yourself") CSS
- Understanding Media Queries better than last week

# Motivation

Last week I was unable to complete the media query extensions. This week, a responsive site was not part of the extensions, but actually part of the project. I wanted to ensure that my site was responsive this week. Also, I wanted to try out the extra tools that I learned such as flex-box.

# Shortcomings

I believe that I focused too much time on my paired project (due the day after this project). I need to do better time-boxing my work in order to spread my attention evenly on all of my tasks. 

# Learning during production

I succeeded in completing the media queries, which successfully made the site responsive. I was excited to find that I enjoyed working on the media queries, which is more about fine-tuning the site rather than creating it from scratch. I also succeeded in keeping my code D.R.Y. from the beginning, which saved time when it came to refactoring. I also think this project was more challenging as it allowed for creative license. All of the images had to be sourced, which took time and planning as opposed to last project. Another small victory was placing an image in the tab heading.
